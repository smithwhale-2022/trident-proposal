\section{Conclusion}

    This project will enable future teams to design feedback control loops for tandem flapping foils based on their observed downstream effects. To do this, the project will build a lateral line using commercially available pressure sensors and characterize the line's response to a single flapping foil. Then, the line will collect wake data from tandem foils flapping at several phase differences. The resultant pressure data will be analyzed for features that differ with respect to phase difference, and a relationship will be inferred between the features and phase difference. Previous work and readily available tools show that these goals are highly attainable. The ability to infer phase difference between two tandem fins will help future teams to improve underwater agility, conduct UUV schooling, and track objects by their wake.
