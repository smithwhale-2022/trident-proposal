\section{Project Goals}

    Based on the qualities observed in nature and the state of current research, this project will target a set of primary and secondary objectives. The primary objectives will serve as the priority in the event of setbacks.

\subsection{Primary Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify numeric characteristics of tandem fin vortex wakes that can be observed using an artificial lateral line.
    \item Infer a relationship between measured vortex wake traits and tandem fin phase difference.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Secondary Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigate a low cost lateral line sensing mechanism for wake detection.
    \item Determine the best measured wake trait for phase angle estimation.
    \item Expand USNA's capability for lateral line sensing.
\end{itemize}
